*This app was built as part of a hiring process test.*

Node.js needs to be installed in order to run this app.

With node, the app itself can be setup using `npm install`, and started using `npm start`.

Once started, the website can be accessed locally at `localhost:3000` through any browser.

The database used is SQLite which is does not need to be separately installed. An existing database `jokes.db` is present in the files, however the app will detect if it is not present and will automatically rebuild it from the `jokes.json` file.
